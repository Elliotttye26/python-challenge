# python-challenge
# Module 3

Within this repo we have analyzed polling and financial information for a real-world example.

The majority of this challenge I practiced within Jupyter to test my functions as I went before moving them over into VS to run all together as one script.

Below are some of the resources for assisting in putting together python functions:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html

The most diffilcut part of this was getting VS code to pull from the correct directory as well as writing the code to a text file.
